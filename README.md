# Mamba Model in Easy Pytorch

This repo contains the _unofficial_ PyTorch implementation of the `Mamba` model as introduced in [Gu & Dao (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752). One can find the official (CUDA) implementation [here](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) or the nice [alxndrTL](https://github.com/alxndrTL/mamba.py) alternative Python implementation. This repo is developed mainly for didactic purposes to spell out the details of a `State Space Models`.

# Usage

# Roadmap

- [ ] Put all the essential pieces together
- [ ] Add functioning training script (Lightning)
- [ ] Show some results
